[Documentation of Snippets in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)

## Use of Snippets

The snippets can be installed global, in folder scope or in your workspace. Drop the `*.code-snippets` file or even files in the hidden `.vscode` folder, if the folder is not there you can just create it.  

Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and description.  

All snippets from KargWare stars with `kw-`. To use them start typing `kw-` and press `Ctrl+Space` to start autocompletion (suggestions will shown as list).
